            Many software engineers enjoy video games, whether casual or competitive. It can be a way to unwind, and some might

            Staying updated with the latest technologies in software engineering is an ongoing process. Some engineers enjoy 
            deep-diving into new frameworks, libraries, or tools just out of curiosity or to stay ahead of trends.
